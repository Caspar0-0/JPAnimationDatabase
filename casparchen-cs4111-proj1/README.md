Website: Modern Japanese Animes Popularity Database
URL: http://35.237.237.243:8111

Descriptions
The “Modern Japanese Animes Popularity Database” is designed to keep track of the information of modern Japanese animes and trends in time about various aspects related to them. Our project aims to provide users a front-end access to a Modern Japanese Animes database. Users will be able to identify entities such as Anime, Genre, Users, Producer, Popularity, Location, and Status, as well as the relationships among entities.
Our main goal for this database is to let users interact with it and ask questions about animes: “What are animes scored over 8.2 subscribed by over 10k people?”; about users:"what are the usernames that users use to watch animes from China/US/Japan?"

-- Something we have not accomplished:
Importing large data into the database.
